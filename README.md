# GigaPen
A big pen. Ideal for 3d printing or 4th axis machining. 

Background: 
I originally designed this pen as a intermediate level CAD lesson in Fusion360. The goal was to have attendees customize, then get a 3d print of their own Giga Pens! Despite the pens size it is rather light when made from a material like Nylon or ABS, and its massive surface area lends itself to easy customization with patterning or embossing. 

Materials (Other than plastic or machined pen body)
- M3x6 or M3x8
- Pilot G2 spring 
- Pilot G2 or compatible cartridge

Instructions: 
Print or machine all three peices of the pen, labeled: part1_... part2_... and part3...
